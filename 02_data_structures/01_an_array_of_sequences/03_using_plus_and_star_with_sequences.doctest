# Using + and * with sequences


Usually both operands of + must be of the same sequence type, and neither of them is modified but a new sequence of the same type is created as result of the concatenation.

>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> l * 5	# A new sequence is created
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
>>> 5 * 'abcd'
'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd'
