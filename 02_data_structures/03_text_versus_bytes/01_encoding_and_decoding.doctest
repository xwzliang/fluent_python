Converting from code points to bytes is encoding; converting from bytes to code points is decoding.

>>> s = 'café'
>>> len(s)
4
>>> b = s.encode('utf8')
>>> b	# bytes literals start with a b prefix
b'caf\xc3\xa9'
>>> len(b)	# bytes b has five bytes (the code point for “é” is encoded as two bytes in UTF-8)
5
>>> b.decode('utf8')
'café'
