# Use a genexp with a Cartesian product to print out a roster of T-shirts of two colors in three sizes.
# The six-item list of T-shirts is never built in memory: the generator expression feeds the for loop producing one item at a time
# If the two lists used in the Cartesian product had 1,000 items each, using a generator expression would save the expense of building a list with a million items just to feed the for loop
