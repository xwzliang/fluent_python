# Use a genexp with a Cartesian product to print out a roster of T-shirts of two colors in three sizes.
# The six-item list of T-shirts is never built in memory: the generator expression feeds the for loop producing one item at a time
# If the two lists used in the Cartesian product had 1,000 items each, using a generator expression would save the expense of building a list with a million items just to feed the for loop

# An elegant application of tuple unpacking is swapping the values of variables without using a temporary variable
>>> a, b = (1, 3)
>>> b, a = a, b
>>> a, b
(3, 1)

# Another wxample of tuple unpacking is prefixing an argument with a star whencalling a function
>>> divmod(20, 8)
(2, 4)
>>> t = (20, 8)
>>> divmod(*t)
(2, 4)

# A further use of tuple unpacking: enabling functions to return multiple values in a way that is convenient to the caller
>>> quotient, remainder = divmod(*t)
>>> quotient, remainder
(2, 4)

# Using * to grab excess items
>>> a, b, *rest = range(5)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [2, 3, 4])
>>> a, b, *rest = range(3)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [2])
>>> a, b, *rest = range(2)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [])
>>> a, *body, c, d = range(5)	# The * prefix can appear in any position
>>> a, body, c, d
(0, [1, 2], 3, 4)
>>> *head, b, c, d = range(5)
>>> head, b, c, d
([0, 1], 2, 3, 4)
